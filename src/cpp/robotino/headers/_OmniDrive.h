/**
 * Reimplementation of the OmniDrive class from RobotinoAPI2
 *
 * The original OmniDrive class handles the omnidirectional drive system of
 * Robotino. This reimplementation enhances the original by automating all
 * drive instructions. By cooperating with the Odometry class _OmniDrive can
 * easily drive Robotino to a destination just by providing the desired
 * coordinate. Other features include pointing at a coordinate, stopping at
 * a desired distance, smooth accelleration and both smooth and emergency
 * stopping.
 *
 * See @link _OmniDrive.h @endlink for documentation of @c \#define parameters
