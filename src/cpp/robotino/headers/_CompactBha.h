/**
 * Reimplementation of the CompactBHA class from RobotinoAPI2
 *
 * The original CompactBHA class handles the compact Bionic Handling Assistant
 * accessory of the Robotino.
 * This reimplementation enhances the original by adding autonomus reactions
 * to forces applied to the cBHA arm. By continously monitoring the cBHA,
 * certain events are detected by analyzing sensor data. When these events
 * are detected, appropriate actions are taken. For example is the gripper
 * closed when it is pushed down, presumably by the weight of an object
 * handed to it. The compressor is enabled and disabled automatically based
 * on the neccessity of air pressure for the given target state.
 *
 * See @link _CompactBha.h @endlink for documentation of @c \#define parameters
